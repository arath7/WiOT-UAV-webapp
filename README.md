# UAV Control Website 
## Overview:
- A basic web application that serves python scripts for running drone flight paths. 
## How to run:
Scripts themselves for controlling the drone are in Scripts directory

- Download the DroneControlServer
Open in VSCode or other IDE, download PHP Server extension.

- Open DroneControlServer/index.php and right click PHP Server: run project 
Have PHP server running.

- Web application will be opened in web browser and from there, scripts will be run on a virtual or physical UAV

## This was my first web application and foray into Python, PHP, Javascript, etc. I am very proud of the learning and self-teaching that went into this project. 

### Next step: improving the front-end aspects to be more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly. 

*To use for virtual UAV, must also open up QGroundControl and start from terminal
